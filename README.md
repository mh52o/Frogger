# FPGA Frogger Game – DE1-SoC Edition 🐸🚗

A Verilog-based implementation of the classic **Frogger** game on the **DE1-SoC FPGA board** using a 16x16 LED matrix display. This project was developed by Morris Huang and Hudson Wong.

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

- **Objective**: Guide the frog across a road full of cars to reach the top of the screen.
- **Lose Condition**: Colliding with a red (car) LED.
- **Win Condition**: Reach the topmost row and press `UP`.
- **Difficulty**: Speeds up after each win. Resets on game over.
- **Controls**:
  - `KEY[0]` – Right
  - `KEY[1]` – Up
  - `KEY[2]` – Down
  - `KEY[3]` – Left
  - `SW[9]` – Reset

### Core Modules

| Module          | Function                                                  |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `frog_LED`      | FSM for frog movement across matrix                       |
| `crossy_road`   | FSM for car movement (red LEDs shift right)              |
| `user_input`    | Button debounce – registers only on rising edge          |
| `clock_divider` | Provides clocks of varying frequencies                    |
| `seeded_LFSR`   | Random car spawn logic                                    |
| `comparator`    | Compares LFSR output to threshold                         |
| `three_bit_counter` | Increments difficulty up to 8 levels                 |
| `victory`       | Detects win/loss and triggers playfield reset            |
| `LEDDriver`     | Drives 16x16 dual-color LED matrix via GPIO              |

## Testbenches Included

Each module has its own testbench verifying:

- FSM transitions
- Clock/reset behavior
- Boundary conditions
- Debounce correctness
- Randomness from LFSR
- Playthrough simulation in `DE1_SoC_testbench`

---

## How It Works

- **Movement** is processed via FSMs in each grid tile.
- **Red LEDs** represent cars spawned randomly by LFSRs and move right.
- **Green LEDs** represent the frog; only one tile is green at a time.
- **Win logic** increases difficulty via a 3-bit counter.
- **Game resets** on collision or after reaching the top.

## Build and Run Instructions

1. Open your **Intel Quartus** project with a DE1-SoC setup.
2. Add all Verilog source files:
   - `DE1_SoC.sv`
   - All module files (e.g., `frog_LED.sv`, `user_input.sv`, etc.)
3. Compile and program onto the FPGA.
4. Use the physical board’s:
   - **KEYs** for control
   - **SW[9]** for reset
   - **GPIO_1** for LED matrix output
5. Run testbenches using **ModelSim** for simulation.
